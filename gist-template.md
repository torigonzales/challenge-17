### Anchors

- Anchors belong to the family of regex tokens that don't match any characters, but that assert something about the string or the matching process. Anchors assert that the engine's current position in the string matches a well-determined location: for instance, the beginning of the string, or the end of a line.

### Quantifiers

- Quantifiers specify how many instances of a character, group, or character class must be present in the input for a match to be found.


### OR Operator

- The regular expression operators are used for matching patterns in searches and for replacements in substitution operations. The m operator is used for matching patterns, and the s operator is used when substituting one pattern for another.

### Character Classes

- The character class is the most basic regex concept after a literal match. It makes one small sequence of characters match a larger set of characters. For example, [A-Z] could stand for any uppercase letter in the English alphabet, and \d could mean any digit. Character classes apply to both POSIX levels.
